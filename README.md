This Project is a recreation of another app I've done in Ionic/Angular.  I've added a note adding functionality to meet the full CRUD requirements on each individual characters page.  The project uses firebase for its database using data I created myself earlier this year.  A few pages(terms) or tables might not load currently as they're still being developed, priority was given to the note taking functionality to meet project requirements.

1. Clone the project and run npm install.

2. Download firebase.js from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d2UOHnODNUp5cJhdbxpys4NW_o1fMY8X and place it in the src/firebase folder(this holds the firebase config information that would get scraped from github by bots)

3. Use npm start to run the project.
