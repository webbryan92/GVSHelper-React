This Project is a recreation of another app I've done in Ionic/Angular.  I've added a note adding functionality to meet the full CRUD requirements on each individual characters page.  The project uses firebase for its database using data I created myself earlier this year.

1. Clone the project and run npm install.

2. Use npm start to run the project.
